Terminal:

pwd : present working directory
cd : change directory
ls : list all files
ls -al : list all files with info
touch : makes new file : touch index.html
mkdir : make new directory : mkdir my-directory-name

    commands to be scared of:
    rm : remove (rm /path/to/file ** no warning!)
    rm -rf : remove directory (rm /path/to/directory ** no warning!)
    sudo : super user do : do some command with root privileges ** scary because it really does anything
